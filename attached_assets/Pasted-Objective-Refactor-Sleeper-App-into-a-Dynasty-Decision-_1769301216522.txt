Objective: Refactor Sleeper App into a "Dynasty Decision Engine"I want to refactor my existing application to pivot from a "spreadsheet-style" viewer to a "Decision Engine" focused on finding league edges. Do not start fresh; refactor the existing code in client/src, server/analytics, and server/routes.ts.1. UI/UX ReorganizationNavigation: Update client/src/components/Layout.tsx and client/src/App.tsx. Create two primary tabs:🏆 Trophy Room: (Move existing League History, H2H, and fun stats here).⚡ Edge Engine: (This should be the new default view, replacing the current "Scouting" logic).Confidence Score: Rename "Coverage %" to "Confidence Score" and display it as a badge (High/Med/Low).2. Backend Analytics Refactor (server/analytics/edgeEngine.ts)Update the computeCompositeScore and DEFAULT_WEIGHTS to use these specific values:45% Starters Value15% Bench Value15% Max PF (Luck Score): Calculate the delta between Actual PF and Max PF. Teams with high Max PF but low Actual PF should be flagged as "Unlucky/Strong."20% Draft Capital Score: Use the weighted scale (1st=3, 2nd=2, 3rd=1, 4th=0.5). Update draftCapital.ts to estimate pick position (Early/Mid/Late) by looking at the original owner's Max PF rank.5% Age Window Score: Use the position-specific age curves already defined in POSITION_AGE_CURVES.3. Trade Radar & Needs EngineEnhance the existing computeTeamNeeds and computeSurplus logic to:Match Assets: Build a matcher that identifies where my "Surplus" positions match an opponent's "Deficit."Classification: Automatically tag every team in the league as: All-in Contender, Fragile Contender, Productive Struggle, or Dead Zone.Trade Finder: Create a UI component in the Edge Engine that suggests specific trade frameworks (e.g., "Your WR depth → Team X's RB need").4. Page Refactor (client/src/pages/Scouting.tsx)Refactor this page to become the Edge Engine Dashboard. It should feature:A sortable True Power Rankings table using the new $45/15/15/20/5$ formula.A Trade Radar section showing "Best Targets" (teams with high trade activity and matching needs).Expandable positional "Age Windows" for each team.

Objective: UI Unification & Migration (Fix the "Split Brain" App)The app currently has fragmented UI. We have a "Profile" page doing too much and a "Trophy Room" / "Edge Engine" doing too little.We are strictly separating concerns:Past $\rightarrow$ Trophy RoomFuture $\rightarrow$ Edge EngineStep 1: The Great Migration (Profile $\rightarrow$ Trophy Room)Source: client/src/pages/Profile.tsxTarget: client/src/pages/TrophyRoom.tsxTask: Move the historical components (LeagueHistoryChart, PastFinishes, HeadToHeadTable) from Profile.tsx into TrophyRoom.tsx.Logic: Ensure TrophyRoom uses the useSleeperHistory hook. If that hook doesn't exist, extract the history fetching logic from Profile.tsx and create it.Outcome: The Trophy Room must show the user's past finishes and titles. It should NOT be empty.Step 2: Consolidate the Decision EngineSource: client/src/pages/Profile.tsx (the "Edge Engine" widgets)Target: client/src/pages/EdgeEngine.tsxTask: Move the "Power Rankings," "Team Needs," "Surplus," and "Trade Targets" logic entirely into EdgeEngine.tsx.Data Source: Update EdgeEngine.tsx to fetch data ONLY from the canonical endpoint: /api/league/:leagueId/power-rankings.Visuals:Display the True Power Score ($45/15/25/10$ split).Display the Archetype Badge (e.g., "Productive Struggle").Display the Age Curve Bar (using AgeScaleBar.tsx).Step 3: Kill the "Profile" PageRefactor: Profile.tsx should now be a simple "Landing Page" or "Dashboard" that only contains:A League Selector (dropdown).A large card linking to 🏆 Trophy Room.A large card linking to ⚡ Edge Engine.Cleanup: Remove all heavy charts and tables from Profile.tsx once they are moved.Step 4: Fix Navigation (Layout.tsx)Update the Sidebar/Header links to match this new reality:Dashboard (was Profile)Trophy Room (History)Edge Engine (Strategy)Player Market (Values)Compare (Head-to-Head Roster Tool)Step 5: Verify the Backend RouteCheck server/routes.ts. Ensure the endpoint GET /api/league/:leagueId/power-rankings is defined and calls computeTeamCompositeValue from server/engine/powerRankings.ts.Critical: If this route is missing, the UI will be blank. Implement it if it's missing.Step 6: Build Integrity CheckScan for Broken Imports: Since we moved components between pages, ensure all import paths in App.tsx and the new pages are updated.Remove Dead Code: Delete any unused imports or variables left over in Profile.tsx after the migration.

Add league power ranking to Profile tiles and sort tiles by it.

1) Server
- Extract existing Teams “Talent Snapshot” computation into server/analytics/power.ts so it can be reused across Teams + Profile.
- Update the Profile overview endpoint that returns league tiles to include:
  tile.power = {
    rank, outOf,
    starters, bench, picksCount,
    picksValue,
    total,
    coveragePct,
    formatFlags
  }
  where these reflect THE USER’S roster for that league + selected season.
- Cache power results per leagueId+season to avoid slow profile loads.
- If coveragePct < 70%, mark power as low-confidence.

IMPORTANT — Draft picks MUST be valued, not just counted.
- Right now Picks shows a count (e.g., “Picks: 14”), but picks are not included in “how good the team is” unless they contribute numeric value to totals/rankings.
- This means one of these is currently true:
  a) picks are displayed but NOT added to total, or
  b) picks are being counted as “number of picks” not “value”, or
  c) pick assets are not flowing through the same valuation pipeline as players.
- Fix requirement:
  - Compute picksValue as a VALUE SUM (numeric) and include it in team totals:
    total = starters + benchWeight * bench + picksValue
  - Prefer using existing trade value data for rookie picks if available.
  - If pick trade values aren’t available, implement a simple v1 pick chart (tunable later):
    1st = 55, 2nd = 30, 3rd = 15, 4th = 7
    apply year discount: same year x1.00, +1 year x0.85, +2 years x0.72, +3 years x0.62
  - picksValue must materially change team total + power rank when picks are traded.
  - Surface BOTH pick count and pick value in the snapshot:
    “Picks: 14 (Value: 112)” not just “Picks: 14”.

2) Client
- On each league tile, display: Power #X/N and Total (and optionally breakdown S/B/P + coverage).
- Default sort order on Profile is by power.rank ascending (valid only when coverage >= 70%).
- Tiles with missing/low-confidence power go to bottom with a concise empty state (Sync / change season).
- In the league Teams list, ensure rows are sorted by power.rank and optionally pin/highlight the user’s team row.

Acceptance
- Profile tiles show power rank and total for leagues with computed values.
- Changing season updates displayed power values (no stale season mixups).
- Tile list sorts strongest leagues to the top by power rank.
- Picks materially change power totals/rank when traded (not just pick count).
- No empty panels: hide sections without data or show a single-line empty state with next action.
